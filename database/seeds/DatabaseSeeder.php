The Land Reform Savings Corporation was merged with ADBN in 1973. Subsequent amendments to the Act empowered the bank to extend credit to small farmers under group liability and expand the scope of financing to promote cottage industries. The amendments also permitted the bank to engage in commercial banking activities for the mobilization of domestic resources. Agricultural Development Bank Limited (ADBL) is an autonomous organization largely owned by Government of Nepal. The bank has been working as a premier rural credit institution since the last three decades, contributing a more than 67 percent of institutional credit supply in the country. Hence, rural finance is the principal operational area of ADBL. Besides, it has also been executing Small Farmer Development Program (SFDP), the major poverty alleviation program launched in the country. Furthermore, the bank has also been involved in commercial banking operations since 1984. The enactment of Bank and Financial Institution Ordinance (BAFIO) in February 2004 abolished all Acts related to financial institutions including the ADBN Act, 1967. In line with the BAFIO, ADBL has been incorporated as a public limited company on July 14, 2005. Thus, ADBL operates as a ""A"" category financial Institution under the legal framework of BAFIO and the Company Act, 2053.';

Despite the cut-throat competition in the Nepalese Banking sector, Himalayan Bank has been able to maintain a lead in the primary banking activities- Loans and Deposits. Legacy of Himalayan lives on in an institution that\'s known throughout Nepal for its innovative approaches to merchandising and customer service. Products such as Premium Savings Account, HBL Proprietary Card and Millionaire Deposit Scheme besides services such as ATMs and Tele-banking were first introduced by HBL. Other financial institutions in the country have been following our lead by introducing similar products and services. Therefore, we stand for the innovations that we bring about in this country to help our Customers besides modernizing the banking sector. With the highest deposit base and loan portfolio amongst private sector banks and extending guarantees to correspondent banks covering exposure of other local banks under our credit standing with foreign correspondent banks, we believe we obviously lead the banking sector of Nepal. The most recent rating of HBL by Bankers’ Almanac as country’s number 1 Bank easily confirms our claim. All Branches of HBL are integrated into Globus (developed by Temenos), the single Banking software where the Bank has made substantial investments. This has helped the Bank provide services like ‘Any Branch Banking Facility’, Internet Banking and SMS Banking. Living up to the expectations and aspirations of the Customers and other stakeholders of being innovative, HBL introduced several new products and services. Millionaire Deposit Scheme, Small and Medium Enterprises Loan, Pre-paid Visa Card, International Travel Quota Credit Card, Consumer Finance through Credit Card and online TOEFL, SAT, IELTS, etc. fee payment facility are some of the products and services. HBL also has a dedicated offsite ‘Disaster Recovery Management System’. Looking at the number of Nepalese workers abroad and their need for formal money transfer channel; HBL has developed exclusive and proprietary online money transfer software- HimalRemitTM. By deputing our own staff with technical tie-ups with local exchange houses and banks, in the Middle East and Gulf region, HBL is the biggest inward remittance handling Bank in Nepal. All this only reflects that HBL has an outside-in rather than inside-out approach where Customers’ needs and wants stand first.';

The story behind the establishment of ""NIRDHAN"" starts from 1986 when Dr. Harihar Dev Pant, the Chief Executive Officer of NUBL/Executive Chairman of ""NIRDHAN"" (then senior officer with central bank of Nepal) visits Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. The visit inspired him to launch microfinance program in Nepal resulting the birth of ""NIRDHAN"" or ""people without money"" in 1991. NIRDHAN began its microfinance operation in March 1993.';

With the amendment in the Power Purchase Agreement between Nepal Electricity Authority and Sanima Mai Hydropower Limited the capacity has been increased to 22MW from 15.6MW.

STC has over 400 staff and has provided opportunities for over 1000 workers and laborers. The group has branches in all major towns in Nepal. STC has 5 production oriented factories. Salt Trading Corporation Limited makes all efforts to provide goods and services to the common people that have made STC a major catalyst in bringing about the desired economic changes and growth in Nepal. STC is not only focusing on providing its services to urban people (residing in towns and metropolis), it also reaches out to the poor and needy people of remote districts of Nepal (e.g. Himalayan regions). Realizing the need of quality products throughout the country by following the Government of Nepalâ€™s policy, Salt Trading Corporation is moving towards business diversification by searching for new products, innovative thoughts and new markets. The organization engaged itself in corporate activities such as trade, import, export, manufacturing (production), processing, supply and distribution of a vast diversity of goods and services. Food products, agricultural products, construction materials, machinery and tools, paper products and other goods are the main commodities for trade and business.
